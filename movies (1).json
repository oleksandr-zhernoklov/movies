    "description": "One night in his near-empty tower block in contemporary London, Adam has a chance encounter with a mysterious neighbor Harry, which punctures the rhythm of his everyday life. As a relationship develops between them, Adam is preoccupied with memories of the past and finds himself drawn back to the suburban town where he grew up, and the childhood home where his parents appear to be living, just as they were on the day they died, 30 years before.",

    "review": "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/all-of-us-strangers-bfi-london-film-festival-review/\r\n\r\n\"All of Us Strangers is, without a doubt, overwhelmingly emotional and brutally devastating. Andrew Haigh explores childhood trauma and the protagonist's complex grieving process through countless memorably powerful, thought-provoking dialogues, performed brilliantly by the entire cast, especially Andrew Scott.\r\n\r\nThe background music by Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch creates an ideal melancholic atmosphere for the heavy, heartbreaking narrative, but the songs chosen for the final phase of the film will induce thousands of tears worldwide.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally loses its thematic focus, and it's unlikely to be watched again anytime soon, but it's even more improbable to be forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",
